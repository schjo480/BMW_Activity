# My Contributions at BMW

This document highlights my contributions to software development projects during my internship at BMW from September 2023 to February 2024. My work involved building two independent projects and making significant contributions to an existing repository for a machine learning model.

## Internship Overview

Throughout my internship at BMW, I had the opportunity to engage in hands-on development, contributing to meaningful projects that enhance the analysis and understanding of vehicle performance and brake noise classification.

## Key Projects

### Project 1: Test Drive Data Analysis Application

- **Description:** Developed a Plotly application for analyzing .mf4 files from BMW testing vehicles. The application visualizes vehicle data over time and provides summarizing statistics. It also features a file upload functionality for Excel files containing output from an onboard device, enabling comparison and validation of new counters and logics.
- **Technologies Used:** Plotly, Python, Data Analysis, Deployment Technologies
- **Outcome:** Delivered a fully functional application that is now used to analyze and validate vehicle test drive data more efficiently.

### Project 2: Brake Noise Analysis Application

- **Description:** Created a second Plotly application that allows users to analyze brake noises recorded during test drives. Users upload .mf4 files, which are processed to extract .wav files. These audio files are sent to an API that uses a machine learning model I contributed to for classification. The application displays predictions, prediction confidence, and relevant vehicle data for each braking event.
- **Technologies Used:** Plotly, Python, Machine Learning API Integration, Audio Data Processing
- **Outcome:** Enabled a streamlined process for classifying and analyzing brake noises, providing valuable insights for vehicle testing teams.

### Machine Learning Model for Brake Noise Classification

- **Contribution:** Played a key role in the development and enhancement of the machine learning model used for classifying brake noise based on audio data.
- **Technologies Used:** PyTorch, Python, AWS Sagemaker, Data Preprocessing, Model Training and Evaluation
- **Outcome:** Improved the accuracy and reliability of the classification model, directly impacting the quality of predictions used in the Brake Noise Analysis Application.

## Contributions and Pull Requests
